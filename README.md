## Introduction

This React Native app is a simple e-learning platform that allows users to browse, buy, and sell courses. It provides basic navigation between different pages, making it easy for users to access the available courses and make transactions. You can use this project as a starting point to build a more sophisticated e-learning platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Yarn is recommended)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/Mohd-Fuzail/classapp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd classapp
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

This will open the Expo DevTools in your default web browser. You can run the app on an Android or iOS emulator or use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to test it.

## Features

### Navigation

The app includes basic navigation features using React Navigation, allowing users to move between different screens:

- Home: The landing page that displays a list of available courses.
- Course Details: Shows detailed information about a specific course, including the course name, description, price, and seller information.
- Buy Course: Allows users to purchase a course.
- Sell Course: Enables course sellers to create and list their courses for sale.

## Usage

You can use this basic app as a starting point for your e-learning platform. To extend its functionality, you can add features like user authentication, a payment gateway, and more advanced course management features. Refer to the [React Navigation documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) to learn how to create and configure navigation routes.
